## Framework Overview
<p align="center">

</p>

In this paper, we propose Super4DR, a radar-centric framework specifically designed for the unique challenges of 4D radar. It comprises a learning-based odometry for pose estimation coupled with a gaussian-based map optimizer to generate dense and complete structure.

## Experiment Results

Through experiments with diverse scenes and radar data on public datasets and a self-collected dataset from our multi-sensor handheld platform, we demonstrate Super4DR’s superior performance across multiple tasks.
